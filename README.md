# Atoti Project Template

This template can be used to start Atoti projects where the goal is to [go into production rather than prototyping in a notebook](https://docs.atoti.io/latest/deployment/going_from_a_notebook_to_an_app.html).

- Dependency management with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)
- Settings management with [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/settings)
- Testing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org)
- Type checking with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org)
- Formatting with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io)
- Linting with [Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs)
- Continuous testing with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
